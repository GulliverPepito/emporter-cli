 The block will be invoked immediately when this method is first called. Afterwards, the block will only be invoked when something
 changes, which can be signaled by calling \c setNeedsDisplay or changing any of the properties of the window which might require a redraw
 (such as its title).
 
 This method will not return until until the window is closed (via \c close) or the user requests termination (SIGINT/SIGTERM via ctrl+C).
 
 Although this method will block, it is done in a way such that events will continue to be dispatched to your application. In other words,
 you will still receive notifications (KVO or otherwise) in addition to delegate callbacks while this method is running.
